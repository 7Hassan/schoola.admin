# 🏗️ Pull Request: Dashboard Route Structure Implementation

## 📋 Summary

This PR implements the foundational route structure for the Schoola dashboard, creating dedicated page components for each navigation section in the dashboard layout. The implementation establishes proper Next.js App Router structure with individual pages for all dashboard sections, transforming the previous static navigation into a functional multi-page application.

## 🎯 Motivation

The Schoola dashboard previously had a monolithic structure with static navigation links that led nowhere. This restructuring was needed to:

- **Enable Navigation**: Convert static sidebar links to functional routes
- **Modular Architecture**: Split functionality into dedicated pages for better maintainability
- **Scalable Foundation**: Create a proper structure for future feature development
- **Improved UX**: Provide clear navigation and proper page structure for admin users
- **Educational Focus**: Establish dedicated spaces for school management features
