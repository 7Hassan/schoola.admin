- Error handling and validation

## Data Models

### Teacher Interface

```typescript
interface Teacher {
  id: string
  // Basic Information
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: string
  phone: string
  gender: 'male' | 'female' | 'not_specified'
  dateOfBirth: string
  nationalId: string
  profilePhoto?: string

  // Professional Details

  subjects: string[]
  qualifications: string[]
  yearsOfExperience: number

  // Employment Information
  employmentType: 'full-time' | 'part-time' | 'contract' | 'substitute'
  salary: number
  startDate: string
  contractEndDate?: string
