# Teacher Assignment System - Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ What We Built

### 1. **Reusable ColorLabel Component** (`/components/ui/color-label.tsx`)

- **Purpose**: Consistent color labeling system for teachers and other entities
- **Features**:
  - 8 predefined color schemes (blue, green, purple, orange, pink, indigo, teal, red)
  - Multiple variants: default, solid, outline
  - Size options: sm, md, lg
  - Removable labels with onClick handlers
  - Consistent teacher color generation based on teacher ID
  - ColorDot helper component for small indicators

### 2. **Enhanced Groups Store** (`/lib/groups-store.ts`)

- **New Types**:
  - `TeacherLectureAssignment`: Links teachers to specific lectures with status tracking
  - Status options: scheduled, completed, current, next, upcoming, dismissed
- **New Store Functions**:
  - `updateTeacherAssignment()`: Update individual lecture assignments
  - `bulkUpdateTeacherAssignments()`: Update multiple assignments at once
  - `getTeacherAssignments()`: Get all assignments for a group
  - `getAssignmentsByTeacher()`: Get assignments filtered by teacher
- **Mock Data**: Added realistic teacher assignments to all sample groups

### 3. **Enhanced Group Cards** (`/components/groups/group-card.tsx`)

- **Teacher Display**:
  - Color-coded teacher labels with assignment counts
  - Consistent colors generated from teacher IDs
- **Lecture Progress Visualization**:
  - Real-time lecture status circles using actual assignment data
  - Teacher assignment indicators with colored rings and borders
  - Enhanced tooltips showing teacher assignments and lecture status
- **Visual Improvements**:
  - Better spacing and organization
  - Real assignment data instead of mock logic

### 4. **Teacher Assignment Manager** (`/components/groups/teacher-assignment-manager.tsx`)

- **Comprehensive Management Interface**:
  - Teacher statistics dashboard showing assignment counts
  - Auto-assignment functionality to distribute lectures evenly
  - Expandable detailed view for granular control
- **Per-Lecture Management**:
  - Teacher selection with color-coded dropdowns
  - Status management (scheduled â†’ upcoming â†’ current â†’ completed â†’ dismissed)
  - Notes field for additional information
- **Bulk Operations**:
  - Save/reset functionality for batch changes
  - Visual indicators for unsaved changes

### 5. **Enhanced Group Drawer** (`/components/groups/group-drawer.tsx`)

- **Integrated Teacher Assignment Section**:
  - Only shows for existing groups (edit mode)
  - Seamless integration with existing form structure
  - Maintains separation of concerns with other group properties

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Examples

### Basic Teacher Assignment

```tsx
// Assign Teacher 1 to Lecture 5 as current
updateTeacherAssignment('group-id', 5, 'teacher-1', 'current', 'Review session')
```

### Bulk Assignment Update

```tsx
// Update multiple lectures at once
bulkUpdateTeacherAssignments('group-id', [
  { lectureNumber: 1, teacherId: 'teacher-1', status: 'completed' },

### Color Label Usage

```tsx
<ColorLabel
  color="blue"
  size="sm"
  removable
  onRemove={() => {}}
