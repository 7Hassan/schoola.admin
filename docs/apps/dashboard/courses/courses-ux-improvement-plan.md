# Courses System UX Improvement Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the changes needed to improve the courses system user experience by following the established patterns from the students system. The changes focus on better accessibility, clearer user flows, and consistent interaction patterns across the dashboard.

---

## Current Analysis

### Current Courses System Issues:

1. **Hidden Actions**: Edit, archive, and delete actions are packed into a 3-dots dropdown menu
2. **No Delete Mode**: No dedicated deletion workflow with batch operations
3. **No Direct Navigation**: Course details are shown in a modal/drawer instead of a dedicated page
4. **Inconsistent UX**: Different interaction patterns compared to students system

### Students System Patterns to Follow:

1. **Clear Top Bar**: Add Student button and Delete Students button in header
2. **Direct Card Actions**: Edit Details button directly on each card
3. **Delete Mode**: Toggle-able deletion mode with multi-select capability
4. **Page Navigation**: Clicking cards navigates to dedicated detail pages
5. **Consistent Button Placement**: Actions are always visible and accessible

**Changes**:

- Add "Delete Courses" button to the top bar next to "Add Course"
- Implement delete mode toggle functionality
- Add conditional header styling for delete mode (red theme)
- Update header text and description based on mode

**New State Management**:

```typescript
// Add to CoursesStore interface
interface CoursesStore {
  // ... existing properties
  isDeleteMode: boolean
  selectedCoursesForDeletion: string[]
  isDeleteModalOpen: boolean

  // ... new methods
  enterDeleteMode: () => void
  exitDeleteMode: () => void
  toggleCourseForDeletion: (courseId: string) => void
  selectAllCoursesForDeletion: () => void
  clearSelectedCoursesForDeletion: () => void
  openDeleteModal: () => void
  closeDeleteModal: () => void
  confirmDeleteSelectedCourses: () => void
  executeDeleteSelectedCourses: () => void
}
```

#### 1.2 Update Courses Store

  {!isDeleteMode && (
    <Button
      onClick={(e) => {
        e.stopPropagation()
        openEditDrawer(course)
      }}
      variant="outline"
      size="sm"
      className="w-full group-hover:bg-blue-50 group-hover:border-blue-200 transition-colors"
    >
      {canEdit ? (
        <>
          <Edit className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
          Edit Details
        </>
      ) : (
        <>
          <Eye className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
          View Details
        </>
      )}
    </Button>
  )}
</div>
```

### 3. Archive Behavior Implementation

**File**: `apps/dashboard/components/courses/course-card.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Add "Archive Course" button alongside the edit button
- Only show for active courses (conditional rendering)

**Archive Button Layout**:

```typescript
// Two-button layout for non-delete mode
<div className="mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-gray-100">
  {!isDeleteMode && (
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      <Button
        onClick={(e) => {
          e.stopPropagation()
          openEditDrawer(course)
        }}
        variant="outline"
        size="sm"
        className="flex-1"
      >
        <Edit className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
        Edit Details
      </Button>

      {course.status !== 'archived' && canEdit && (
        <Button
          onClick={(e) => {
            e.stopPropagation()
            archiveCourse(course.id)
          }}
          variant="outline"
          size="sm"
          className="flex-1"
        >
          <Archive className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
          Archive
        </Button>
      )}
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

### 4. Course Details Page Implementation

#### 4.1 Create Course Profile Page

**File**: `apps/dashboard/app/(dashboard)/courses/profile/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Create new dynamic route for course details
- Move course details view from drawer to dedicated page
- Follow students profile page pattern
- Include comprehensive course information display

**Route Structure**:

```
app/(dashboard)/courses/
├── create/
│   └── page.tsx
├── management/
│   └── page.tsx
├── profile/
│   └── [id]/
│       └── page.tsx        # New course details page
└── page.tsx
```

#### 4.2 Update Course Card Click Behavior

**File**: `apps/dashboard/components/courses/course-card.tsx`

**Changes**:

- Use Next.js router for navigation

**Navigation Logic**:

```typescript
const handleCardClick = () => {
  if (isDeleteMode) {
    toggleCourseForDeletion(course.id)
  } else {
    // Navigate to course profile
    router.push(`/courses/profile/${course.id}`)
  }
}
```
