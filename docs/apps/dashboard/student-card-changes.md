# Student Card Changes Implementation

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed Email Field from Card Display

- **File**: `apps/dashboard/components/students/student-card.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed the email display section from the card UI
- **Note**: Email is still available and editable in the drawer when editing

### 2. ✅ Made Phone Number Clickable for Dialing

- **File**: `apps/dashboard/components/students/student-card.tsx`
- **Change**: Converted phone number from `<span>` to `<a href="tel:...">` with click handler to prevent card navigation
- **Features**:
  - Hover effects (blue color and underline)
  - Prevents card click event propagation
  - Proper tel: protocol for mobile dialing

### 3. ✅ Implemented Student Profile Navigation

- **Files Created**:
  - `apps/dashboard/app/(dashboard)/students/profile/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `apps/dashboard/components/students/student-card.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Card body click navigates to dedicated student profile page
  - Comprehensive profile view with all student details
  - Edit button in card still opens the drawer for editing
  - Back navigation and breadcrumbs
  - Responsive design with detailed information layout

### 4. ✅ Fixed Destructive Button Text Visibility Issue

- **File**: `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- **Problem**: Destructive buttons had red background AND red text (invisible text)
- **Solution**: Changed `--destructive-foreground` from red to white in light mode
- **Result**: Destructive buttons now have red background with white text (proper contrast)

## New Route Structure

```
/students/profile/[id] - Individual student profile page
```
