# Create Pages Cleanup - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully resolved the file naming inconsistency where some create pages had duplicate files (`page.tsx` and `page-new.tsx`). All create pages now consistently use `page.tsx` with the most recent unified versions.

## Actions Taken

### ✅ File Standardization

- **Locations**: Replaced `page.tsx` with `page-new.tsx` (newer version with manual edits)
- **Courses**: Replaced `page.tsx` with `page-new.tsx` (newer version with manual edits)
- **Forms**: Replaced `page.tsx` with `page-new.tsx` (newer version with manual edits)
- **Groups**: Replaced `page.tsx` with `page-new.tsx` (newer version with manual edits)

### ✅ Cleanup Completed

- Removed all duplicate `page-new.tsx` files
- Removed temporary backup files
- All create pages now have consistent naming: `page.tsx`

## Final File Structure

```
apps/dashboard/app/(dashboard)/
├── locations/create/page.tsx    (17,715 bytes - unified layout)
├── courses/create/page.tsx      (27,422 bytes - unified layout)
├── forms/create/page.tsx        (16,988 bytes - unified layout)
├── groups/create/page.tsx       (33,768 bytes - unified layout)
└── teachers/create/page.tsx     (6,282 bytes - original, not unified)
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 🎯 Consistency

- All create pages now use standard `page.tsx` naming
- No more duplicate or confusing file names
- Clear, predictable file structure

### 📦 Clean Codebase

- Eliminated redundant files
- Preserved most recent versions with manual edits
- Maintained all unified layout functionality

### 🛠️ Maintainability

- Developers know exactly which file to edit
- No confusion about which version is current
- Standard Next.js page routing conventions followed

## Current Status

All 4 unified create pages (locations, courses, forms, groups) are now:

- ✅ Using consistent `page.tsx` naming
- ✅ Containing the most recent manual edits
- ✅ Implementing the unified layout system
- ✅ Ready for Phase 3 testing and validation

The teachers create page remains unchanged as it was not part of the unification process.
